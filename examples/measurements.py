"""Example OpenHTF test demonstrating use of measurements.

Run with (your virtualenv must be activated first):

  python measurements.py

Afterwards, check out the output in measurements.json.  If you open both this
example test and that output file and compare them, you should be able to see
where measurement values end up in the output and what the corresponding code
looks like that sets them.

TODO(someone): Write these examples.
For more complex topics, see the validators.py and dimensions.py examples.

For a simpler example, see the hello_world.py example.  If the output of this
test is confusing, start with the hello_world.py output and compare it to this
test's output.

Some constraints on measurements:

  - Measurement names must be valid python variable names.  This is mostly for
    sanity, but also ensures you can access them via attribute access in phases.
    This applies *after* any WithArgs() substitution (not covered in this
    tutorial, see the phases.py example for more details).

  - You cannot declare the same measurement name multiple times on the same
    phase.  Technically, you *can* declare the same measurement on multiple
    phases; measurements are attached to a specific phase in the output.  This
    isn't recommended, though, because it makes it difficult to flatten a test's
    measurements, which some output formats require.

# You won't normally need to import this, see validators.py example for
# more details.  It's used for the inline measurement declaration example
# below, but normally you'll only import it when you want to define custom
# measurement validators.
from openhtf.util import validators

# Import a handful of useful names.  If you're worried about polluting
# your namespace, you can manually import just the things you want, this

# Multiple measurements can be specified in a single decorator, using either of
# the above syntaxes.  Technically, these syntaxes can be mixed and matched, but
# as a matter of convention you should always use one or the other within a
# single decorator call.  You'll also note that you can stack multiple
# decorations on a single phase.  This is useful if you have a handful of simple
# measurements, and then one or two with more complex declarations (see below).

# These additional attributes can also be specified inline as kwargs passed
# directly to the @measures decorator.  If you do so, however, you must
# specify exactly one measurement with that decorator (ie. the first argument
# must be a string containing the measurement name).  If you want to specify
