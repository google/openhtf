  This is used to convert some special types of objects used internally into
  base types for more friendly output via mechanisms such as JSON.  It is used
  for sending internal objects via the network and outputting test records.
  Specifically, the conversions that are performed:

    - If an object has an _asdict() method, use that to convert it to a dict.
    - mutablerecords Record instances are converted to dicts that map
      attribute name to value.  Optional attributes with a value of None are
      skipped.
    - Enum instances are converted to strings via their .name attribute.
    - Real and integral numbers are converted to built-in types.
    - Byte and unicode strings are left alone (instances of basestring).
    - Other non-None values are converted to strings via str().

  The return value contains only the Python built-in types: dict, list, tuple,
  str, unicode, int, float, long, bool, and NoneType (unless tuple_type is set
  to something else).  If tuples should be converted to lists (e.g. for an
  encoding that does not differentiate between the two), pass 'tuple_type=list'
  as an argument.
