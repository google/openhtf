"""Monitors provide a mechanism for periodically collecting data and
automatically persisting values in a measurement.

Monitors are implemented similar to phase functions - they are decorated
with plugs.requires() to pass plugs in.  The return value of a monitor
function, however, will be used to append a value to a measurement.

Monitors by default poll at a rate of 1 second between invokations of
the monitor function.  The poll interval (given in milliseconds) determines the
minimum time between invokations of the monitor function, so if the monitor
function runs for longer than the poll interval, the monitor function will be
immediately invoked again after returning.  A poll interval of 0 will cause
the monitor function to be called in a tight loop with no delays.

Example:

@plugs.requires(current_meter=current_meter.CurrentMeter)
def CurrentMonitor(test, current_meter):
  return current_meter.GetReading()

@monitors.Monitors('current_draw', CurrentMonitor, units=units.UOM['AMPERE'])
def MyPhase(test):
  # Do some stuff for a while...

# MyPhase will have a dimensioned measurement on it, with units of 'AMPERE' and
# a single dimension of 'MILLISECONDS', and will have values for roughly every
# second while MyPhase was executing.
