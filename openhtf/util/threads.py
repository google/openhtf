  Based on recipe available at http://tomerfiliba.com/recipes/Thread2/

  Note: To fully address race conditions involved with the use of
  PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc, the GIL must be held from when the thread is
  checked to when it's async-raised. In this case, we're not doing that, and
  there remains the remote possibility that a thread identifier is reused and we
  accidentally kill the wrong thread.

  The kill method will only kill a background thread that (1) has not started
  yet or (2) is currently running its _thread_proc function.  This ensures that
  the _thread_exception and _thread_finished methods are not affected, so state
  can be properly determined.  In addition, this prevents thread termination
  during garbage collection.
