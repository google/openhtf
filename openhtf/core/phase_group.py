"""Phase Groups in OpenHTF.

Phase Groups are collections of Phases that are used to control phase
shortcutting due to terminal errors to better guarentee when teardown phases
run.

PhaseGroup instances have three primary member fields:
  `setup`: a list of phases, run first.  If these phases are all non-terminal,
      the PhaseGroup is entered.
  `main`: a list of phases, run after the setup phases as long as those are
      non-terminal.  If any of these phases are terminal, then the rest of the
      main phases will be skipped.
  `teardown`: a list of phases, guarenteed to run after the main phases as long
      as the PhaseGroup was entered.  If any are terminal, other teardown phases
      will continue to be run.  One exception is that a second CTRL-C sent to
      the main thread will abort all teardown phases.
There is one optional field:
  `name`: str, an arbitrary description used for logging.

PhaseGroup instances can be nested inside of each other.  A PhaseGroup is
terminal if any of its Phases or further nested PhaseGroups are also terminal.
