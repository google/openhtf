        non-empty DUT ID *must* be set by the end of a test, or no output

        test_start argument to openhtf.Test.Execute(), or may be set in a
        test phase via this attribute.

    logger: A Python Logger instance that can be used to log to the resulting
        TestRecord.  This object supports all the usual log levels, and
        outputs to stdout (configurable) and the frontend via the Station
        API, if it's enabled, in addition to the 'log_records' attribute
        of the final TestRecord output by the running test.

    measurements: A measurements.Collection object used to get/set
        measurement values.  See util/measurements.py for more implementation
        details, but in the simple case, set measurements directly as
        attributes on this object (see examples/measurements.py for examples).

    state: A dict (initially empty) that is persisted across test phases (but
        resets for every invocation of Execute() on an openhtf.Test).  This
        can be used for any test-wide state you need to persist across phases.
        Use this with caution, however, as it is not persisted in the output
        TestRecord or displayed on the web frontend in any way.

    test_record: A reference to the output TestRecord for the currently
        running openhtf.Test.  Direct access to this attribute is *strongly*
        discouraged, but provided as a catch-all for interfaces not otherwise
        provided by TestApi.  If you find yourself using this, please file a
        feature request for an alternative at:
          https://github.com/google/openhtf/issues/new

  Callable Attributes:
    attach: Attach binary data to the test, see TestState.attach().

    attach_from_file: Attach binary data from a file, see
        TestState.attach_from_file().

    get_attachment:  Get copy of attachment contents from current or previous
        phase, see TestState.get_attachement.

    get_measurement: Get copy of a measurement from a current or previous phase,
        see TestState.get_measurement().

    notify_update: Notify any frontends of an interesting update. Typically
        this is automatically called internally when interesting things happen,
        but it can be called by the user (takes no args), for instance if
        modifying test_record directly.



  Read-only Attributes:
    attachments: Dict mapping attachment name to test_record.Attachment
        instance containing the data that was attached (and the MIME type
        that was assumed based on extension, if any).  Only attachments
        that have been attached in the current phase show up here, and this
