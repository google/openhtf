"""Monitors provide a mechanism for periodically collecting data and
automatically persisting values in a measurement.

Monitors are implemented similar to phase functions - they are decorated
with plugs.plug() to pass plugs in.  The return value of a monitor
function, however, will be used to append a value to a measurement.

Monitors by default poll at a rate of 1 second between invokations of
the monitor function.  The poll interval (given in milliseconds) determines the
approximate frequency at which values will be sampled.  A sample is considered
to have been taken at the time when the monitor function *returns*, not when
it is called.

The approximate average duration of calls to the monitor function is taken into
account, so that samples are obtained on as close to interval_ms boundaries as
can be.  A poll interval of 0 will cause the monitor function to be called in a
tight loop with no delays.

Example:

@plugs.plug(current_meter=current_meter.CurrentMeter)
def CurrentMonitor(test, current_meter):
  return current_meter.GetReading()

@monitors.monitors('current_draw', CurrentMonitor, units=units.AMPERE)
def MyPhase(test):
  # Do some stuff for a while...

# MyPhase will have a dimensioned measurement on it, with units of 'AMPERE' and
# a single dimension of 'MILLISECONDS', and will have values for roughly every
# second while MyPhase was executing.
