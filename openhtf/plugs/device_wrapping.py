"""OpenHTF base plugs for thinly wrapping existing device abstractions.

Sometimes you already have a Python interface to a device or instrument; you
just need to put that interface in plug form to get it into your test phase.
Device-wrapping plugs are your friends in such times.

  """A base plug for wrapping existing device abstractions.

  Attribute access is delegated to the _device attribute, which is normally set
  by passing some device instance to the constructor of this base class.
  Subclasses can use the @conf.inject_positional_args decorator on their
  constructors to get any configuration needed to construct the inner device
  instance.

  Example:
    class BleSnifferPlug(DeviceWrappingPlug):
      ...
      @conf.inject_positional_args
      def __init__(self, ble_sniffer_host, ble_sniffer_port):

            ble_sniffer.BleSniffer(ble_sniffer_host, ble_sniffer_port))
        ...

  Because not all third-party device and instrument control libraries can be
  counted on to do sufficient logging, some debug logging is provided here in
  the plug layer to show which attributes were called and with what arguments.

  Args:
    device: The device to wrap; must not be None.

  Raises:
    openhtf.plugs.InvalidPlugError: The _device attribute has the value None
        when attribute access is attempted.
