"""User-facing interface to an ADB device.

This module provides the user-facing interface to controlling ADB devices with
this library.  See adb_protocol.py for a breakdown of the various layers.
Essentially, this module provides the AdbDevice class, which takes a UsbHandle
and uses the layers in between to provide a high level interface that is
designed to be similar to the 'adb' commandline interface.

Some additional useful mechanisms are provided for more common programmatic
needs, see shell_service.py for a description of how to use asynchronous shell
commands.

Note we don't provide a device listing facility, as this is not actually an ADB
function, but rather a USB function - listing devices with a specific interface
class, subclass, and protocol.
