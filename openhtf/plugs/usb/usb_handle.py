"""Base interface for communicating with USB devices.

This module provides the base classes required to support interfacing with USB
devices through a few different types of USB handles.  All handles implement the
UsbHandle interface, which contains Open, Close, Read, and Write functionality.
A UsbHandle object represents a single USB Interface, *not* an entire device.

  """UsbHandle objects provide read/write access to USB Interfaces.

  Subclasses must implement this interface to provide actual Read/Write/Close
  functionality.  Applications using UsbHandle objects should be agnostic as to
  the specific implementation used (ie, should only use methods exposed in this
  base class), and should use the subclasses only to determine the mechanism by
  which the handle is opened.

  Read and Write perform a Bulk or Interrupt transfer, depending on the type of
  the endpoints opened, so that applications need only open the correct
  Interface and call Read or Write, without having to worry about whether it is
  a Bulk or Interrupt transfer.

  It is recommended that subclasses implement the following Open() and
  iter_open() classmethods:
    Open():
      Minimum Args:
        interface_class: USB interface_class to match
        interface_subclass: USB interface_subclass to match
        interface_protocol: USB interface_protocol to match
        serial_number: USB serial number to match
        default_timeout_ms: Default timeout to use for the returned Handle.

      Returns:
        Instance of UsbHandle for communicating with the matched device, or
      None if no matching device was found.

      Raises:
        MultipleInterfacesFoundError: If multiple interfaces were found that
      match the given criteria.

    iter_open():
      Same Args as Open(), but instead of returning a UsbHandle, yields
    UsbHandle instances for all matching connected devices.

  Attributes:
    name: Name assigned to this handle, used for logging purposes.
    serial_number: Serial number of the device this handle refers to.
