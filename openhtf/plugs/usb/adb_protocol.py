"""ADB protocol implementation.

Implements the ADB protocol as seen in Android's adb/adbd binaries, but only the
host side.  ADB communication is organized into messages (see adb_message.py).
Streams are built on top of these messages, using local and remote id numbers
to multiplex over the single channel (called the 'transport' here).

When a host connects to a device, there is first a CNXN handshake, which may
require authorization via AUTH messages.  Then, to connect to a particular
service on the device, the host sends an OPEN message containing local id by
which to refer to the resulting stream.  The classes defined here represent a
connection to a device with an AdbConnection, and an individual stream with an
AdbStream.

Multiple AdbStreams can be opened at once and used by multiple threads, and a
single AdbStream can have multiple threads reading from or writing to it, but
the latter is not recommended.

This implementation of the ADB stack looks something like:

  AdbDevice (Provides an interface similar to the adb commandline tool)
   |                 |
   V                 |
  AdbShellService    |
   |                 V
   |            AdbFilesyncService (Provides file push/pull functionality)
   |                 |
   V                 V
  AdbStream (Many may be opened simultaneously)
     |
     V
  AdbStreamTransport (Handles stream multiplexing and data queueing)
     |
     V
  AdbConnection (Only one open on a particular transport at a time)
     |
     V
  AdbMessage (Many of these are sent, comprising handshaking and AdbStreams)
     |
     V
  AdbTransportAdapter (Handles serialization/deserialization of messages)
     |
     V
  UsbHandle (Really, any transport that provides Read/Write, but usually USB)

Only AdbStream, AdbStreamTransport, and AdbConnection are implemented here.
This stack includes various utility classes that are intended for internal use
only, the classes implemented here that are intended for external users are:

  AdbStream: Intended to be used by anyone implementing their own service
    within ADB (such as shell:, tcp:, etc).  If you want to add support for
    a new service, you'll take in an AdbStream and use it for reads/writes
    from/to the remote endpoint for your service.

Example usage of a connection and stream:
  # Establish a connection to a device connected via my_usb_handle.
  connection = adb_protocol.AdbConnection.connect(my_usb_handle)

  # Read data from a 'shell:ls' destination stream and print the output.
  for line in connection.streaming_command('shell', 'ls'):
    print line
