"""The plugs module provides boilerplate for accessing hardware.

Most tests require interaction with external hardware.  This module provides
framework support for such interfaces, allowing for automatic setup and
teardown of the objects.

Test phases can be decorated as using Plug objects, which then get passed
into the test via parameters.  Plugs are all instantiated at the
beginning of a test, and all plugs' tearDown() methods are called at the
end of a test.  It's up to the Plug implementation to do any sort of
is-ready check.

A plug may be made "frontend-aware", allowing it, in conjunction with the
Station API, to update any frontends each time the plug's state changes. See
FrontendAwareBasePlug for more info.

Example implementation of a plug:

  from openhtf import plugs

  class ExamplePlug(plugs.BasePlug):
    '''A Plug that does nothing.'''

    def __init__(self):
      print 'Instantiating %s!' % type(self).__name__

    def DoSomething(self):
      print '%s doing something!' % type(self).__name__

    def tearDown(self):
      # This method is optional.  If implemented, it will be called at the end
      # of the test.
      print 'Tearing down %s!' % type(self).__name__

Example usage of the above plug:

  from openhtf import plugs
  from my_custom_plugs_package import example

  @plugs.plug(example=example.ExamplePlug)
  def TestPhase(test, example):
    print 'Test phase started!'
    example.DoSomething()
    print 'Test phase done!'

Putting all this together, when the test is run (with just that phase), you
would see the output (with other framework logs before and after):

  Instantiating ExamplePlug!
  Test phase started!
  ExamplePlug doing something!
  Test phase done!
  Tearing down ExamplePlug!

Plugs will often need to use configuration values.  The recommended way
of doing this is with the conf.inject_positional_args decorator:

  from openhtf import plugs
  from openhtf.util import conf

  conf.declare('my_config_key', default_value='my_config_value')

  class ExamplePlug(plugs.BasePlug):
    '''A plug that requires some configuration.'''

    @conf.inject_positional_args
    def __init__(self, my_config_key)
      self._my_config = my_config_key

Note that Plug constructors shouldn't take any other arguments; the
framework won't pass any, so you'll get a TypeError.  Any values that are only
known at run time must be either passed into other methods or set via explicit
setter methods.  See openhtf/conf.py for details, but with the above
example, you would also need a configuration .yaml file with something like:

  my_config_key: my_config_value

This will result in the ExamplePlug being constructed with
self._my_config having a value of 'my_config_value'.
