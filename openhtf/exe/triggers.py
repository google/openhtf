"""Module for handling the triggering of test start/stop.

In order for the TestExecutor (see exe/__init__.py) to know when to start a
test, it needs a way to know when a DUT has been connected.

This module provides some built-in triggers. Custom implementations of test
start triggers must follow the following interface:

TestStart:
  Args:
    None
  Returns:
    DUT identifier, or None if it is not known at test start time.

  # before (it should have returned lambda: serial), so I doubt anyone is
  # actually using it, but just to be safe.
