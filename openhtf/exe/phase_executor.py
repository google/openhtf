"""PhaseExecutor module for handling the phases of a test.

Each phase is an instance of phase_data.PhaseInfo and therefore has relevant
options. Each option is taken into account when executing a phase, such as
checking options.run_if as soon as possible and timing out at the appropriate
time.

A phase must return an openhtf.PhaseResult, one of CONTINUE, REPEAT, or STOP.
A phase may also return None, or have no return statement, which is the same as
returning openhtf.PhaseResult.CONTINUE.  These results are then acted upon
accordingly and a new test run status is returned.

Phases are always run in order and not allowed to loop back, though a phase may
choose to repeat itself by returning REPEAT. Returning STOP will cause a test to
stop early, allowing a test to detect a bad state and not waste any further
time. A phase should not return TIMEOUT or ABORT, those are handled by the
framework.

  phase_result is an instance of Exception, then that is the Exception that

  a convenience to test for that condition, and the is_timeout attribute can
  similarly be used to check for the timeout case.

  The only accepted values for phase_result are None (timeout), an instance
  of Exception (phase raised), or an instance of openhtf.PhaseResult.  Any
