Changes for 2.0.

* PhaseOptions:
    * The openhtf.TestPhase alias for PhaseOptions has been deprecated for a
        long time.  Removing it.
* PhaseDescriptor:
    * If the options name field is a callable, the name property of
        PhaseDescriptors will only return the name of the function rather than
        the callable.  This ensures that the name property is always Text.
