Changes for 2.0.

* Dropped Python 2.x support.
* Added type annotations.
* Replaced mutablerecords with attrs.
* PhaseOptions:
    * The openhtf.TestPhase alias for PhaseOptions has been deprecated for a
        long time.  Removing it.
* PhaseDescriptor:
    * with_known_plugs and with_known_args are being rolled into with_plugs and
         with_args, respectively.  They will no longer raise exceptions when
         the names are not found.
    * If the options name field is a callable, the name property of
        PhaseDescriptors will only return the name of the function rather than
        the callable.  This ensures that the name property is always Text.
* Test:
    * The test teardown has been removed in favor of using a PhaseGroup.
* Unit testing:
    * Unit tests using openhtf.util.test.TestCase can customize the test start
        function when yielding openhtf.Test instances by setting the
        `test_start_function` attribute.  This can be set to None to remove the
        function.
