"""Utility script to periodically poll for station info on the local network.

This script will poll for updates at a regular interval and update the terminal
with information about currently known stations, tests, and history (in summary
form only).

This is handy for getting an at-a-glance picture of OpenHTF stations running on
a network without having to spin up a frontend server.

# TODO(madsci): Implement flags for verbosity control, logs, poll interval.

Example:
  python poll_stations.py

Outputs something like, which updates regularly:
